# Egypt Current Account Forecasting – PhD Research Project

This repository contains time-series forecasting models for key components of Egypt’s current account, including remittances, Suez Canal revenues, and tourism income. The aim is to evaluate and compare traditional econometric approaches and modern machine learning techniques to improve forecast accuracy.

This project is part of my ongoing PhD in Data Science, where I focus on building, testing, and refining models that support economic policy analysis and international reporting. The work is still in progress, and models are continuously being developed and updated.

## Research Importance

This study contributes to the macroeconomic and econometric modelling literature in several ways. First, it is one of the few studies specifically focused on forecasting Egypt’s current account and its components. While much of the existing literature covers general current account forecasting, few models are tailored to Egypt’s unique economic structure. By adapting econometric forecasting models to the Egyptian context, this research provides policymakers with reliable tools to support economic planning. Currently, the Central Bank of Egypt is the primary institution producing such forecasts; this project aims to expand access to such tools for other institutions and researchers.

## Tools Used

- Python (pandas,seaborn,matplotlib, statsmodels, scikit-learn)
- EViews
- Excel

## Objectives

The main objective of the study is to use and apply suitable econometric models to forecast Egypt’s current account. To achieve this, the following goals are pursued:

- Understand structural trends in key external sector indicators
- Forecast merchandise exports and imports
- Construct econometric models to forecast key service balance items (Suez Canal and travel)
- Develop a robust model to forecast worker remittances
